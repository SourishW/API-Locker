##Inspiration

Real Life Scenario: A family friend's company's developer in charge of maintaining a service left the team. Lack of communication and documentation in place, so service was left untouched Production systems went down because a 3rd party license expired! (Clients were unhappy!)

##What it does

We need a service that can generate and maintain documentation for APIs and other artifacts. A way of managing services in a portal, including maintaining stages of a service. A tool that allows us to manage our licenses!

##How we built it

Coded with React Uses the Microsoft Authentication Library to sign in and auth users Uses Microsoft Graph for Office 365 Uses Azure Active Directory to manage permissions for users Hosted on Azure Static Sites
